# That ask method I showed you was OK, but I bet you could do better. 
# Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. 
#Youâ€™ll have to use return to exit from the loop. 
#(Well, it will get you out of the whole method, 
# but it will get you out of the loop in the process.) 
# How do you like the resulting method? 
# I usually try to avoid using return (a personal preference), 
# but I might make an exception here.
